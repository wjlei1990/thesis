One area devoid of support, however, has been parallel file systems, which are critical for high-performance I/O on such clusters. We have developed a parallel file system for Linux clusters, called the Parallel Virtual File System (PVFS). PVFS is intended both as a high-performance parallel file system that anyone can download and use and as a tool for pursuing further research in parallel I/O and parallel file systems for Linux clusters.},

abstract = {Performance of the ITER is anticipated to be highly sensitive to the edge plasma condition. The edge pedestal in ITER needs to be predicted from an integrated simulation of the necessary first-principles, multi-scale physics codes. The mission of the SciDAC Fusion Simulation Project (FSP) Prototype Center for Plasma Edge Simulation (CPES) is to deliver such a code integration framework by (1) building new kinetic codes XGC0 and XGC1, which can simulate the edge pedestal buildup; (2) using and improving the existing MHD codes ELITE, M3D-OMP, M3D-MPP and NIMROD, for study of large-scale edge instabilities called Edge Localized Modes (ELMs); and (3) integrating the codes into a framework using cutting-edge computer science technology. Collaborative effort among physics, computer science, and applied mathematics within CPES has created the first working version of the End-to-end Framework for Fusion Integrated Simulation (EFFIS), which can be used to study the pedestal-ELM cycles.},

abstract = {We present a full seismicwaveformtomography for upper-mantle structure in the Australasian region. Our method is based on spectral-element simulations of seismic wave propagation in 3-D heterogeneous earth models. The accurate solution of the forward problem ensures that waveform misfits are solely due to as yet undiscovered Earth structure and imprecise source descriptions, thus leading to more realistic tomographic images and source parameter estimates. To reduce the computational costs, we implement a long-wavelength equivalent crustal model. We quantify differences between the observed and the synthetic waveforms using timefrequency (TF) misfits. Their principal advantages are the separation of phase and am- plitude misfits, the exploitation of complete waveform information and a quasi-linear relation to 3-D Earth structure. Fr echet kernels for the TF misfits are computed via the adjoint method. We propose a simple data compression scheme and an accuracy-adaptive time integration of the wavefields that allows us to reduce the storage requirements of the adjoint method by almost two orders of magnitude. To minimize the waveform phase misfit, we implement a pre-conditioned conjugate gra- seismograms, recorded in the Australasian region between 1993 and 2008. The waveforms comprise fundamental- and higher-mode surface and long-period S body waves in the period range from 50 to 200 s. To improve the convergence of the algorithm, we implement a 3-D initial model that contains the long-wavelength features of the Australasian region. Resolution tests indicate that our algorithm converges after around 10 iterations and that both long- and short-wavelength features in the uppermost mantle are well resolved. There is evidence for effects related to the non-linearity in the inversion procedure. After 11 iterations we fit the data waveforms acceptably well; with no significant further dient algorithm. Amplitude information is incorporated indirectly by a restricted line search. This ensures that the cumulative envelope misfit does not increase during the inversion. An efficient pre-conditioner is found empirically through numerical experiments. It prevents the concentration of structural heterogeneity near the sources and receivers. We apply our waveform tomographic method to 1000 high-quality vertical-component improvements to be expected. During the inversion the total fitted seismogram length increases by 46 per cent, providing a clear indication of the efficiency and consistency of the iterative optimization algorithm. The resulting SV-wave velocity model reveals structural features of the Australasian upper mantle with great detail. We confirm the existence of a pronounced low-velocity band along the eastern margin of the continent that can be clearly distinguished against Precambrian Australia and the microcontinental Lord Howe Rise. The transition from Precambrian to Phanerozoic Australia (the Tasman Line) appears to be sharp down to at least 200 km depth. It mostly occurs further east of where it is inferred from gravity and magnetic anomalies. Also clearly visible are theArchean and Proterozoic cratons, the northward contin- uation of the continent and anomalously low S-wave velocities in the upper mantle in central Australia. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of non-linear full seismicwaveform tomography to a continental-scale problem.},

abstract = {We use a spectral-element method to simulate seismic wave propagation throughout the entire globe. The method is based upon aweak formulation of the equations of motion and combines the flexibility of a finite-element method with the accuracy of a global pseudospectral method. The finite-element mesh honours all first- and second-order discontinuities in the earth model. To maintain a relatively constant resolution throughout the model in terms of the number of grid points per wavelength, the size of the elements is increased with depth in a conforming fashion, thus retaining a diagonal mass matrix. In the Earths mantle and inner corewe solve the wave equation in terms of displacement, whereas in the liquid outer core we use a formulation based upon a scalar potential. The three domains are matched at the inner core and core mantle boundaries, honouring the continuity of traction and the normal component of velocity. The effects of attenuation and anisotropy are fully incorporated. The method is implemented on a parallel computer using a message passing technique. We benchmark spectral-element synthetic seismograms against normal-mode synthetics for a spherically symmetric reference model. The two methods are in excellent agreement for all body- and surface-wave arrivals with periods greater than about 20 s.},

@inproceedings{Lofstead2009,
abstract = {Since IO performance on HPC machines strongly depends on machine characteristics and configuration, it is important to carefully tune IO libraries and make good use of appropriate library APIs. For instance, on current petascale machines, independent IO tends to outperform collective IO, in part due to bottlenecks at the metadata server. The problem is exacerbated by scaling issues, since each IO library scales differently on each machine, and typically, operates efficiently to different levels of scaling on different machines. With scientific codes being run on a variety of HPC resources, efficient code execution requires us to address three important issues: (1) end users should be able to select the most efficient IO methods for their codes, with minimal effort in terms of code updates or alterations; (2) such performance-driven choices should not prevent data from being stored in the desired file formats, since those are crucial for later data analysis; and (3) it is important to have efficient ways of identifying and selecting certain data for analysis, to help end users cope with the flood of data produced by high end codes. This paper employs ADIOS, the adaptable IO system, as an IO API to address (1)-(3) above. Concerning (1), ADIOS makes it possible to independently select the IO methods being used by each grouping of data in an application, so that end users can use those IO methods that exhibit best performance based on both IO patterns and the underlying hardware. In this paper, we also use this facility of ADIOS to experimentally evaluate on petascale machines alternative methods for high performance IO. Specific examples studied include methods that use strong file consistency vs. delayed parallel data consistency, as that provided by MPI-IO or POSIX IO. Concerning (2), to avoid linking IO methods to specific file formats and attain high IO performance, ADIOS introduces an efficient intermediate file format, termed BP, which can be converted, at small - cost, to the standard file formats used by analysis tools, such as NetCDF and HDF-5. Concerning (3), associated with BP are efficient methods for data characterization, which compute attributes that can be used to identify data sets without having to inspect or analyze the entire data contents of large files.},

The new crustal model reveals strong heterogeneity, including local changes of +/-30\% with respect to the initial three-dimensional model provided by the Southern California Earthquake Center. The model illuminates shallow features such as sedimentary basins and compositional contrasts across faults. It also reveals crustal features at depth that aid in the tectonic reconstruction of southern California, such as subduction-captured oceanic crustal fragments.

The method is based on the generalized least-squares criterion, and it can handle errors in the data set and a priori information on the model. Multiply reflected energy is naturally taken into account, as well as refracted energy or surface waves. The inverse problem can be solved using an iterative algorithm which gives, at each iteration, updated values of bulk modulus, density, and time source function. Each step of the iterative algorithm essentially consists of a forward propagation of the actual sources in the current model and a forward propagation (backward in time) of the data residuals. The correlation at each point of the space of the two fields thus obtained yields the corrections of the bulk modulus and density models. This shows, in particular, that the general solution of the inverse problem can be attained by methods strongly related to the methods of migration of unstacked data, and commercially competitive with them.},

abstract = {We present Swift, a system that combines a novel scripting language called SwiftScript with a powerful runtime system based on CoG Karajan, Falkon, and Globus to allow for the concise specification, and reliable and efficient execution, of large loosely coupled computations. Swift adopts and adapts ideas first explored in the GriPhyN virtual data system, improving on that system in many regards. We describe the SwiftScript language and its use of XDTM to describe the logical structure of complex file system structures. We also present the Swift runtime system and its use of CoG Karajan, Falkon, and Globus services to dispatch and manage the execution of many tasks in parallel and grid environments. We describe application experiences and performance experiments that quantify the cost of Swift operations.},

  abstract = {Over the past few years resilience has became a major issue for high-performance computing (HPC) systems, in particular in the perspective of large petascale systems and future exascale systems. These systems will typically gather from half a million to several millions of central processing unit (CPU) cores running up to a billion threads. From the current knowledge and observations of existing large systems, it is anticipated that exascale systems will experience various kind of faults many times per day. It is also anticipated that the current approach for resilience, which relies on automatic or application level checkpoint/ restart, will not work because the time for checkpointing and restarting will exceed the mean time to failure of a full system. This set of projections leaves the community of fault tolerance for HPC systems with a difficult challenge: finding new approaches, which are possibly radically disruptive, to run applications until their normal termination, despite the essentially unstable nature of exascale systems. Yet, the community has only five to six years to solve the problem. This white paper synthesizes the motivations, observations and research issues considered as determinant of several complimentary experts of HPC in applications, programming models, distributed systems and system management.},

  abstract = {Seismic tomography has been a vital tool in probing the Earth's internal structure and enhancing our knowledge of dynamical processes in the Earth's crust and mantle. While various tomographic techniques differ in data types utilized (e.g., body vs. surface waves), data sensitivity (ray vs. finite-frequency approximations), and choices of model parameterization and regularization, most global mantle tomographic models agree well at long wavelengths, owing to the presence and typical dimensions of cold subducted oceanic lithospheres and hot, ascending mantle plumes (e.g., in central Pacific and Africa). Structures at relatively small length scales remain controversial, though, as will be discussed in this paper, they are becoming increasingly resolvable with the fast expanding global and regional seismic networks and improved forward modeling and inversion techniques. This review paper aims to provide an overview of classical tomography methods, key debates pertaining to the resolution of mantle tomographic models, as well as to highlight recent theoretical and computational advances in forward-modeling methods that spearheaded the developments in accurate computation of sensitivity kernels and adjoint tomography. The first part of the paper is devoted to traditional traveltime and waveform tomography. While these approaches established a firm foundation for global and regional seismic tomography, data coverage and the use of approximate sensitivity kernels remained as key limiting factors in the resolution of the targeted structures. In comparison to classical tomography, adjoint tomography takes advantage of full 3D numerical simulations in forward modeling and, in many ways, revolutionizes the seismic imaging of heterogeneous structures with strong velocity contrasts. For this reason, this review provides details of the implementation, resolution and potential challenges of adjoint tomography. Further discussions of techniques that are presently popular in seismic array analysis, such as noise correlation functions, receiver functions, inverse scattering imaging, and the adaptation of adjoint tomography to these different datasets highlight the promising future of seismic tomography. },
