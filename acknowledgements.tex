I want to first give thanks to my advisor, Jeroen Tromp.
It is one of my best experience to work with him for the past six years.
The more I worked with him, the more I realized he is such a talented,
knowledgable and easy-going person. He is also willing to help his students anytime.
Whenever I got a question, I just go and knock his door. He will do his best to help me.
If it is a questions related to my research, he would go from the very basic to
explain my questions in very details.
There are times when we have difficulties and chanllenges during the past six years.
Jeroen is also has a personality to encourage us and go back to the right track.
He has a great vision and always dedicated to achieve the goal, and he is willing to
share his optimisum and courage with others.

I also want to give thanks to my committee members: Allan Rubin, Frederik Simons
and Jessica Irving. They provide me a lot of help during my generals and let me
pass it saftely. In my global projects, they also provide my numerous suggetions
and insights that help me to better undetstand the model and create new ideas.

I would like to acknowledge my colleagues in seismology group: Hom Nath Gharti,
Matthieu Levebfre, James Smith, Ryan Modrak, Yanhua Yuan, Uno B. Vaaland, David Luet...
Hom Nath Gharti has been my office mate since four years ago.
He is such a knowledgable and friendly person. It was my best memories to stay
at Room 309 and I feel that is my "home".
It is hard to image if we didn't have Matthieu in
our group for the past six years. I learned so much technique knowledge from him
. He is always the first person I could go to ask for help if I had a technique
problem.
It is also great to work with James Smith and Ryan Modrak on the same global
projects and many associated sub-projects. They are the person I can always
rely on.

I would also like to take this chance to acknowledge all previous members in our
group: Ebru Bozdag, Hejun Zhu, Qinya Liu, Min Chen, Carl Tape, Dimitri Komatitsch
Daniel Peter...Their work built the foundation of adjoint tomography workflow.
I also want to give special thanks to Ebru, Hejun and Min. They provided me with
their models, so I can compare my models with theirs. I also had numerous discussion
with them in AGU and other occassions, which provide me with new insights into
our model and bring the GLAD-M25 to final fruition. Just before the submission of our
GLAD-M25 model, I was shocked to hear that Dimitri Komatitsch passed away unexpectedly.
He is a computational geophysicist extraordinaire who built the family of SPECFEM
software together with Jeroen.

I want to thank students and friends in the Geoscience departments: Yajun Peng, Wenbo Wu, 
Pathikrit Bhattacharya, Farhan Nuruzzaman, Cara Magnabosco. It is always joyful to talk
with you. I gave my best wishes to our administrative assistants: Mary
Rose Russo, Sheryl Robas. It is their work and efforts to make it possible for us
to focus on research.

I want to thank my former advisor at USTC, Xiaofei Chen. I did a summer project with him
and it is him who introduced me into geophysics. From him and Jeroen, I feel their passion
and dedication to geophyscis research. They are my role models in my future career.

I give final thanks to my parent, Jinfu Lei and Shenglan Lou, and my girlfriend Qizhi Xu.
It is your support, love and care that make my life so meaningful and joyful, and make
me become who I am today.
