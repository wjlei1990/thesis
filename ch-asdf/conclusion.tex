\section{Conclusions and Future Directions}

ASDF has been developed with the broader seismological community in mind, and
our hope is that scientists within this community will continually test, offer
feedback, and improve the format and its associated tools.  Through such a
communal effort, we will gracefully meet future data challenges and empower
ourselves to make new scientific discoveries.

All components of the format, including its definition, implementation, and
other tools, are freely available under open source licenses and hosted on
GitHub. A central entry point is the \url{http://seismic-data.org} website. We
welcome any outside comments, criticisms, and success stories, and we are
committed to maintaining the documentation and implementations for the foreseeable
future.
