\section{Implementations}

We developed three usable implementations of the ASDF format and expect more to
follow:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A C library with Fortran bindings to read and write ASDF files. This
        is for example used in the SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE
        \cite{KoTr02a, KoTr02b} wave propagation solver.
    \item A Python library to read, write, and convert ASDF files to a large
        number of other formats backed by the ObsPy library \cite{Megies2011,
        Krischer2015}.
    \item A graphical user interface to visually and interactively explore the
        contents of ASDF files.
\end{enumerate}

Technological advances often make existing codes and tools obsolete in a matter
of just a few years, and we anticipate that these implementations will continue
to undergo rapid development and expansion.
